# HTTP API Reference

ilold exposes an HTTP API on the configured port (default 3001). All endpoints return JSON. The API is split into three groups: command bus, session queries, and contract queries.

## Command bus

### POST /api/cmd

Execute a session command. This is the single entry point for all state-mutating session operations.

**Request body:**

```
{
  "contract": "Staking",          // optional, defaults to session contract
  "command": { "Call": { "func": "deposit" } }
}
```

**Supported commands:**

| Command | Payload | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `Call` | `{ "func": "deposit", "trace_config": null }` | Add a function call as a session step |
| `Back` | `"Back"` | Remove the last step |
| `Clear` | `"Clear"` | Remove all steps |
| `State` | `"State"` | Return accumulated state variable summary |
| `Functions` | `"Functions"` | List functions of the current contract |
| `FunctionsAll` | `"FunctionsAll"` | List all accessible functions including inherited |
| `StateVarsAll` | `"StateVarsAll"` | List all accessible state variables including inherited |
| `Who` | `{ "variable": "totalStaked" }` | Find all writers and readers of a variable |
| `Finding` | `{ "severity": "High", "title": "...", "description": "..." }` | Record an audit finding |
| `Note` | `{ "text": "..." }` | Record a free-text note |
| `Status` | `{ "func": "deposit", "status": "Reviewed" }` | Set review status for a function |
| `Session` | `"Session"` | Return session overview (contract, steps, finding count) |
| `Export` | `"Export"` | Export session journal as markdown |
| `SaveSession` | `"SaveSession"` | Serialize session to JSON |
| `LoadSession` | `{ "json": "..." }` | Restore session from serialized JSON |

**Response:** A `CommandResult` variant matching the command type. Key variants:

- `StepAdded`: `step_index`, `function`, `access`, `state_changed` (list of variable names)
- `StateView`: `summary` (list of variable summaries with writers per step)
- `FunctionList`: `functions` (name, access level, writes_state, has_external_calls)
- `VariableInfo`: `variable`, `writers` (name + access), `readers` (name + access)
- `Error`: `message`

## Session query endpoints

These endpoints read from the active session. They return 404 if no session exists (no `Call` command has been issued).

### GET /api/session/state

Returns the accumulated state variable summary across all session steps.

**Response:** Array of `VariableSummary` objects with variable name, type, and per-step write details.

### GET /api/session/sequence

Returns a sequence narrative describing the relationship between session steps. Requires at least 2 steps.

**Response:** `SequenceNarrative` with per-step summaries and flow summaries derived from persisted flow trees.

### GET /api/session/step/{index}/narrative

Returns the function narrative for a specific session step.

**Path params:** `index` -- zero-based step index.

**Response:** `FunctionNarrative` with paths, state writes, external calls, and conditions.

### GET /api/session/step/{index}/trace

Returns the persisted FlowTree of a session step. This is the tree captured when `Call` was executed, not a recomputation.

**Path params:** `index` -- zero-based step index.

**Response:** `FlowTree` with step nodes, each containing operation type, target, conditions, and child steps. Returns 404 if the step has no persisted tree (pre-Phase-2a sessions).

### GET /api/session/timeline/{variable}

Returns a chronological timeline of every write to `variable` across all session steps. Matches by base name (e.g., `balances` matches `balances[msg.sender]`).

**Path params:** `variable` -- state variable name.

**Response:** `VariableTimeline` with `state_entries` and `local_entries`. Each entry contains: `session_step_index`, `function`, `target`, `operator`, `value_expr`, `reached_when` (path conditions), `via` (modifier name if applicable), `scope`.

### GET /api/session/slice/{function}/{variable}

Returns a dataflow slice for `variable` inside `function` of the session's current contract.

**Path params:** `function` -- function name, `variable` -- variable name.

**Query params:**

| Param | Values | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `direction` | `backward`, `forward`, `both`, `b`, `f`, `all` | `both` | Slice direction |

**Response:** `SliceResult` with `backward` and `forward` arrays. Each entry contains: `path`, `span` (source location), `text` (rendered statement), `origin` (`FunctionBody` or `Modifier(name)`).

### GET /api/session/trace/{contract}/{func}

Returns a FlowTree for the given function, computed on demand from the current analysis data.

**Path params:** `contract` -- contract name, `func` -- function name.

**Query params:**

| Param | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `depth` | integer | 2 | Maximum inline depth for internal calls |
| `reverts` | boolean | false | Include revert paths in the tree |
| `expand` | string | empty | Comma-separated step IDs to force-inline beyond max depth (e.g., `17,24`) |

**Response:** `FlowTree` with nested step nodes representing the execution flow.

### GET /api/session/function/{contract}/{func}

Returns a function narrative without requiring a session step. Useful for inspecting functions that have not been called in the session.

**Path params:** `contract` -- contract name, `func` -- function name.

**Response:** `FunctionNarrative` with paths, state effects, and behavioral summary.

## Contract query endpoints

These endpoints read from the static analysis data and do not require an active session.

### GET /api/project

Returns a project summary with file count and a list of contracts (name, kind, function count, state variable count, inheritance).

### GET /api/project/map

Returns the full project map with all contracts, their functions (with path counts and external call flags), state variables, and cross-contract relationships extracted from call graphs.

### GET /api/contract/{name}

Returns contract detail: name, kind, inheritance chain, functions (with path stats), state variables, and inherited functions and state variables.

### GET /api/contract/{name}/callgraph

Returns the call graph for a contract in Cytoscape-compatible JSON format. Nodes represent functions (with contract, type, external flag). Edges represent calls (with kind and count).

### GET /api/contract/{name}/{func}/cfg

Returns the control flow graph for a function in Cytoscape-compatible JSON format. Nodes represent basic blocks (entry, normal, return, revert, assembly, loop). Edges represent control flow transitions.

### GET /api/contract/{name}/{func}/paths

Returns the path tree for a function. Contains all execution paths with stats (total, happy, revert) and per-path annotations (state writes, external calls, events).

### GET /api/contract/{name}/sequences

Returns the sequence tree for a contract, showing function interaction patterns.

### GET /api/contract/{name}/analysis

Returns the sequence analysis for a contract: per-function behavior summaries (state writes, state reads, external calls, conditions) and inter-function transition information.

### GET /api/contract/{name}/suggestions

Returns search suggestions for the contract: function names, state variable names, event names, external call targets, and predefined categories (revert, return, assembly).

## Solana-specific endpoints

Solana shares `/api/cmd`, `/api/project`, `/api/project/map`, `/ws`, and most session endpoints with the Solidity backend. The following routes are Solana-only:

| Endpoint | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/program/{name}/view` | Full `ProgramView` for the named program: instructions (with args, accounts, signers, PDAs, admin-gated flag, coupling hints), account types, discriminators. |
| `GET /api/program/{name}/overlay` | Runtime overlay aggregated over the active scenario: calls-per-instruction, failures, CU stats, CPI edges. |
| `GET /api/users/{scenario}/labels` | Returns the keypair labels for a given scenario (used by the web canvas to render `users new <name>` aliases). |
| `GET /api/scenarios` | Scenario list for the active program (active marker, step counts). |
| `GET /api/scenarios/all` | Scenario list across every program in the workspace. |

`POST /api/cmd` carries a `SolanaCommand` payload (`Call`, `Users`, `UsersNew`, `Airdrop`, `TimeWarp`, `Pda`, `Inspect`, `Scenario`, `SaveSession`, `LoadSession`, …; see `crates/ilold-solana-core/src/exploration/commands.rs`). The response is a `SolanaCommandResult` variant (`StepAdded`, `CallFailed`, `StateView`, `Timeline`, `Coverage`, etc.).

## WebSocket

`GET /ws` upgrades to a WebSocket connection. See [WebSocket events](./websocket.md) for the full event vocabulary and payload shapes.

A second WebSocket route `GET /ws/pty` provides a PTY bridge used by the embedded REPL in the web canvas.
