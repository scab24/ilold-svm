# Known Limitations

This page documents the current analysis boundaries of ilold. Understanding these limitations is necessary for interpreting slice, timeline, and trace results correctly.

## Intraprocedural slicing only

The dataflow slicer operates within a single function body (plus its inlined modifiers). It does not follow values across function call boundaries. If `deposit` calls an internal helper `_updateBalance(amount)`, the slice for `amount` in `deposit` will show the call site but not the writes inside `_updateBalance`. Use `tr <func>` to inspect internal call bodies separately.

## Assignment-only DEF extraction

Only `Assignment` expressions (`x = ...`, `x += ...`, `x -= ...`) produce DEF entries in the slicer's use-def analysis. Solidity mutations that are not modeled as assignments -- specifically `x++`, `x--`, `++x`, `--x`, `delete x`, `arr.push(v)`, and `arr.pop()` -- are captured as USEs of the target variable but not as DEFs. A backward slice on a variable mutated exclusively through `.push()` will miss the mutating statement as a definition point.

## Modifier placeholder split

Modifier bodies are split at the first top-level `_;` (placeholder) statement to separate "before" code from "after" code. If the placeholder appears inside a nested block (e.g., inside an `if` branch), the entire modifier body is treated as "before" code. This is over-inclusive: statements that should execute after the function body will appear before it in the flattened view. In practice, most modifiers place `_;` at the top level, so this rarely triggers.

## Forward slice over-tainting via ancestor merge

When a statement is included in a forward slice, its lexical ancestors (enclosing `if`, `for`, `while` blocks) are also included so that the rendered slice shows control-flow context. The ancestor's condition variables are merged into the tainted set. This means an `if (unrelatedCondition)` enclosing a tainted write will add `unrelatedCondition` to the taint set, potentially pulling in unrelated statements in subsequent iterations. The result is a conservative (larger) slice rather than a precise one.

## Tuple destructuring

Tuple destructuring assignments such as `(a, b) = foo()` may not be recognized as DEFs depending on how the Solidity frontend lowers them. If the frontend does not emit a top-level `Assignment` node, the individual targets (`a`, `b`) are treated as USEs only. This can cause a backward slice to miss the destructuring as a definition point for `a` or `b`.

## Timeline tracks state mutations only

The `timeline` command tracks writes to state variables across session steps. Local variable assignments within a function body are recorded separately (`local_entries`) but are not visible in the default timeline output. If you need to trace a local variable, use `slice` within the specific function instead.

## Session requires at least one call

The `timeline`, `state`, and `sequence` endpoints require an active session with at least one `Call` step. The `timeline` and `state` commands return empty results if no steps have been added. The `sequence` command requires at least two steps. Use `tr <func>` for read-only inspection of a function's flow without adding it to the session.

## Internal and private functions cannot be session entry points

Session steps model real external transactions. Functions with `internal` or `private` visibility cannot be called from outside the contract, so they cannot be added as session steps via `c <func>`. Use `tr <func>` to inspect their execution flow, or call a public/external function that invokes them to see their effects through the modifier and internal-call inlining in the trace.
